Compared with other organizations' products, the biggest feature of Traveling Masters' is the focus on different experience. The trip provided by Traveling Master will not provide repeated experience but highly differentiated ones. For example, if someone plans to go for a 3-day trip in a city, Traveling Master will try to analyze this city and segment its neiborhoods in terms of nearby venues so that the customer and experience as many different things as he can in the limited time. This report will show one way Traveling Master uses for segementing, taking Toronto as an example.",

Second, more data such as latitudes and longitudes will be added into data from the first step. Third, from Foursquare API, nearby venues for each neighborhood will be retrieved. Based on this information, neighborhoods would be segemented into three different categories and this information can be used by Traveling Master to plan a 3-day trip for its customer in Toronto.",

The segementation criteria is not that proper\nIt is tested in the first step, which means nearby venues may not be the most proper information for planning a trip. Most venues significant for residents, which are the main factors that we use to segement neighborhoods, may be meaningless to tourists. For example, tourists' experience may not be influenced that much by the number of grocery stores and hospitals but in this algorithm, they are allocated with undeserved weight.",
