Second, more data such as latitudes and longitudes will be added into data from the first step. Third, from Foursquare API, places to go for each neighborhood will be retrieved. Based on this information, neighborhoods would be segemented into three different categories and this information can be used by Traveling Master to plan a 3-day trip for its customer in Toronto.",
